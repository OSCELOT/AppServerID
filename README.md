# AppServerID
The system provides information about the current application server. In a load balanced environment it may be difficult to determine which application server a user is connected to. In order to get log files from the correct system or to troubleshoot other issues, the identification of the current app server is important. This building block can be reached through the Admin tab, Community System module, or direct url. The url can be posted as an iframe on help desk page.  Host name, IP, CPU usage, and other data is provided. 

Once the B2 is installed the url will be: /webapps/dtii-AppID-bb_bb60/index.jsp
